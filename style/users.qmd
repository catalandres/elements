# Usernames

Users will be named following the following policy:

- Users in Production:

    ```
    [user email].[MyDomain name of the org system]
    ```

    Example: `ava.gardner@acmecorp.com.acmesales`

- Users in a sandbox:

    ```
    [user email].[MyDomain name of the org system].[name of the sandbox]
    ```

    Example:`spencer.tracy@acmecorp.com.acmesales.dev`

## Motivation

Usernames must be globally unique across all Salesforce orgs and customers.
While emails are unique within the organization, when an organization has (or will have, or will continue to have) multiple Salesforce org systems[^1], and sandbox names are not unique across org systems, so we need to use the MyDomain name to namespace them and make them truly unique.

[^1]: An "org system" is a production environment and all its sandboxes.
